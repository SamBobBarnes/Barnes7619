    "body": "I am a Software Engineering and Information Technology major with a minor in Industrial Technology at William Penn University. \n \n I hope to get a job in the tech industry after I graduate in the fall of 2020. I have tons of experience using, fixing, building, and programming computers that started in the sixth grade and continues to be my passion to this day. I program for fun and like to dip my toes into as many technologies as I can get my hands on. \n \n I have experience in many programming languages, libraries and frameworks including HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, SQL, Node.js, React, P5.js, Python, C, C#, C++, Java, Batch, and I have experience with software like Unity, Blender, and Xcode. I am also familiar with CAD and have experience using Inventor, Fusion 360, AutoCAD, and PTC Creo. I am an avid maker and enjoy spending my time modeling useful things and 3D printing them. In my free time I often work on various coding or modeling projects as I like the challenge of creating something from scratch that didnâ€™t exist before."
